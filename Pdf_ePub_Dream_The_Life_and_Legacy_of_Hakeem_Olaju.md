Overview
The life and legacy of pioneering international basketball superstar Hakeem Olajuwon, a two‚Äëtime NBA champion whose Hall of Fame career forever changed the game, both in the United States and around the globe‚Äîfrom the New York Times bestselling author of Giannis, Mirin Fader.
 
 It‚Äôs now the norm for NBA and collegiate teams to have international players dotting their rosters. The Olympics are no longer a gimme for Team USA. Both via fans streaming from all over the globe and leagues starting in countries throughout the world, the international presence of the game of basketball is a force to be reckoned with.
 
 That all started with Hakeem ‚Äúthe Dream‚Äù Olajuwon. He was the first international player to win the MVP, which is hard to believe now considering the last time an American‚Äëborn player won it was in 2018. Award-winning hoops journalist Mirin Fader explores this phenomenal shift through the lens of what Olajuwon accomplished throughout the 1980s and ‚Äò90s. Dream ignites nostalgia for Phi Slama Jama and ‚Äúthe Dream Shake,‚Äù while also exploring the profound influence of Olajuwon‚Äôs commitment to Islam on his approach to life and basketball, and how his devotion to his faith inspired generations of Muslim people around the world.
 
 Olajuwon‚Äôs ongoing work with NBA Africa, his status as an international ambassador for the game, and his consultations with today‚Äôs brightest stars, from LeBron James to Giannis Antetokounmpo, brings the story right up to the present moment, and beyond. Synthesizing hundreds of interviews and in-depth research, Fader provides the definitive biography of Olajuwon as well as a crucial understanding of his pivotal impact on the ever-shifting game.
