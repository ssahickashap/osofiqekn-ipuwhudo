Overview
The incredible return to the New York Times bestselling world of the Night Angel, where master assassin Kylar Stern embarks on a new adventure as the High King Logan Gyre calls on him to save his kingdom and the hope of peace.

&quot;Weeks has been showing other fantasy authors how it&#039;s done for over fifteen years.&quot;Â â€”Â Peter V. Brett, author ofÂ The Desert Prince

&quot;Weeks is a giant of the genre.&quot;Â â€”Â Nicholas Eames, author ofÂ Kings of the WyldAfter the war that cost him so much, Kylar Stern is broken and alone. He&#039;s determined not to kill again, but an impending amnesty will pardon the one murderer he can&#039;t let walk free. He promises himself this is the last time. One last hit to tie up the loose ends of his old, lost life.

 But Kylar&#039;s best â€” and maybe only â€” friend, the High King Logan Gyre, needs him. To protect a fragile peace, Loganâ€™s new kingdom, and the kingâ€™s twin sons, he needs Kylar to secure a powerful magical artifact that was unearthed during the war.

 With rumors that a ka&#039;kari may be found, adversaries both old and new are on the hunt. And if Kylar has learned anything, itâ€™s that ancient magics are better left in the hands of those he can trust.

 If he does the job right, he wonâ€™t need to kill at all. This isnâ€™t an assassination â€” itâ€™s a heist.

 But some jobs are too hard for an easy conscience, and some enemies are so powerful the only answer lies in the shadows.

&quot;Weeks writes in an inescapably engaging style. Breathlessly high stakes, terrible missteps, and unexpected revelations keep the story humming along at a breakneck pace.&quot;Â â€” Andrea Stewart, author ofÂ The Bone Shard Daughter
