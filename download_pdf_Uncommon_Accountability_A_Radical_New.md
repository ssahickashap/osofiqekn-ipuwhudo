Overview
Own your choices and discover the true meaning of accountability The implementation of true, organization-wide accountability has the potential to transform your firm‚Äôs‚Äîand your personal‚Äîperformance. Unfortunately, the word ‚Äúaccountability‚Äù often has negative connotations, including blame, fear, and conflict. In Uncommon Accountability, best-selling authors and leadership strategists Brian Moran and Michael Lennington compellingly argue for a positive and affirming conception of accountability‚Äîone that stands for personal ownership of one‚Äôs goals, actions, and progress. The authors show you how to harness the power of accountability, with all of its built-in potential to enable growth and learning, improve well-being, reduce stress, and drive results. You‚Äôll also learn to: Manage negative consequences by ‚Äúholding others capable‚Äù and stop playing the blame game Shift your thinking to take real advantage of simple behavior changes that improve results and engagement Emphasize the power and importance of personal choice in every interaction Containing real-world case studies that show you how to apply the principles contained within to your own circumstances, Uncommon Accountability is the perfect tool to unlock the potential of your team members.
