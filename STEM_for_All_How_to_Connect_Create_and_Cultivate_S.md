Overview
Help close the STEM gap through theory and practical tools Containing all of the practical tools needed to put theory into practice, STEM for All by Leena Bakshi McLean provides a roadmap for teachers, instructional coaches, and leaders to better understand the challenges that create low engagement and scores in STEM subjects and implement exciting and culturally relevant teaching plans. This book covers a wealth of key topics surrounding the subject, including classroom culture, discourse, identity, and belonging, family and community participation, and justice-centered core learning. This book uses the Connect, Create, and Cultivate framework from STEM4Real, an organization that provides socially just and culturally relevant STEM teaching and standards-based learning strategies, combined with stories and case studies of real students throughout to provide context for key concepts. In this book, readers will learn about: Six pillars that can throw off the foundation of a classroom, including non-inclusive curriculum and lack of equal access Moments of triumph and resilience that can be used to navigate rocky and recalcitrant relationships Implicit and unconscious biases that can unravel our impact despite our best intentions STEM for All earns a well-deserved spot on the bookshelves of all educators motivated to close the STEM gap and better prepare their students for future college and career opportunities in math and science fields.
